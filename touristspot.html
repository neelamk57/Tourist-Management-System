</br> </br>  The database is maintained of the hotel services including the cost per room, cost per meal, number of rooms available, etc. of each hotel and the transport facilities information is also maintained. The tourists are able to choose the sites to visit and also to compare the budget of travel to different places. Tourists can also compare the services and the cost provided by different transport and hotels for similar facilities by simply accessing database.
The convergence of these different organizations also leads to generate a summary for the concerned authorities like Tourism Department of the actual flow of tourists and the expense of travel to a certain place. We aim to build to website for both the tourists and the authorities to have a clear notion of state of present tourism industry and to highlight the areas where development is crucial for overall development of tourism industry.
